# Security Policy

## üîí Security Considerations

### Demo Credentials
This lab uses **demo credentials** for educational purposes:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `DevSecOps2024!`

üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE:**
- These are **DEMO CREDENTIALS ONLY** - Never use in production!
- The password `DevSecOps2024!` appears in 20+ files for lab consistency
- This is **intentional** for educational/demo purposes
- **ALWAYS change all credentials** before any production use

‚ö†Ô∏è **PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Change all default passwords immediately
2. Use environment variables or secrets management
3. Enable proper authentication and authorization
4. Review all configuration files for hardcoded secrets
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Enable multi-factor authentication
4. Use secrets management systems

### Lab Environment Security
This lab is designed for **local development and learning**:
- All services run locally on your machine
- No external network exposure by default
- Demo data and intentionally vulnerable applications included

### Production Deployment
Before using any components in production:
1. **Change all default credentials**
2. **Review and harden all configurations**
3. **Enable proper authentication and authorization**
4. **Use secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)**
5. **Enable network security (TLS, firewalls, etc.)**
6. **Regular security updates and monitoring**

## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities in this lab:
1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer privately
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for assessment and fixes

## üîç Security Features Demonstrated

This lab showcases:
- **Vulnerability scanning** with Trivy, Grype, Syft
- **Policy-based security gates**
- **SBOM generation** for supply chain security
- **Audit trails** and compliance reporting
- **Container security** best practices
