curl -u admin:Aa1234567 http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/status
```

### 2. Run Security Scan
```bash
# Scan any Docker image
docker-compose exec security-scanner trivy image alpine:latest

# Or use local tools
./scripts/security/scan.sh alpine:latest
```

### 3. Test Policy Gates
```bash
# Test security policy enforcement
docker-compose exec security-scanner /app/scripts/security/policy-gate.sh

# Or use local scripts
./scripts/security/policy-gate.sh
```

### 4. Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Simulate full CI/CD pipeline
./scripts/simulate-ci.sh
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Automated Vulnerability Management
- **Zero Critical Policy** - No critical vulnerabilities allowed in production
- **Risk-Based Thresholds** - Configurable limits for High/Medium/Low severity
- **Multi-Scanner Validation** - Trivy (primary) + Grype (alternative)
- **SBOM Generation** - Complete software inventory (755 components tracked)

### Policy Enforcement
- **Automated Gates** - Pass/Fail decisions based on vulnerability severity
- **Emergency Bypass** - Controlled override with full audit trail
- **Metadata Tracking** - Complete build and security information
- **Compliance Ready** - Audit trails meet regulatory requirements

### Real-World Security Testing
- **Intentional Vulnerabilities** - Sample app with SQL injection, XSS, secrets
- **Container Security** - Base image and dependency scanning
- **Supply Chain Security** - Complete visibility from source to production

## üîß Configuration

### Default Security Policies
```bash
GATE_FAIL_ON_CRITICAL=true    # Zero tolerance for critical vulnerabilities
GATE_MAX_HIGH=5               # Maximum 5 high-severity vulnerabilities
GATE_FAIL_ON_MEDIUM=false     # Allow medium-severity (configurable)
```

### Customize Policies
```bash
# Edit .env file to adjust thresholds
nano .env

# Restart services to apply changes
docker-compose restart
```

## üìö Available Commands

### Service Management
```bash
# Start lab
./quick-start.sh

# Start with containerized scanner
./quick-start.sh --with-scanner

# Stop lab
docker-compose down

# Clean up everything
./quick-start.sh --clean
```

### Security Operations
```bash
# Scan container image
docker-compose exec security-scanner trivy image myapp:latest

# Run policy gate evaluation
docker-compose exec security-scanner /app/scripts/security/policy-gate.sh

# Complete security pipeline
docker-compose exec security-scanner /app/scripts/security/integrate-gate.sh myapp:latest
```

### Local Development
```bash
# All original scripts still work
./scripts/security/scan.sh myapp:latest
./scripts/security/policy-gate.sh
./scripts/simulate-ci.sh

# API operations
./scripts/api/create-repos.sh
./scripts/api/upload-artifact.sh myfile.jar
./scripts/api/query-artifacts.sh
```
